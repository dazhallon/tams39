\subsection*{(a)}
\label{sec:a-5}


The foll wing linear model was designed
\begin{equation*}
  \b Y = \b{XB},
\end{equation*}
where $\b Y$ is the out parameters and $\b X$ is the design matrix
\begin{equation*}
  \b X = (\b 1_n, \b x_1, \b x_2),
\end{equation*}
and $\b B:(3 \times 4) $ contained the unknown parameter values, which
was estimated using linear regression as
\begin{equation*}
  \b B =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    -94.60 &-228.67 &-258.80 &-246.05 &-232.96 \\ 
    19.27 &43.65 &48.99 &47.33 &45.10 \\ 
    -24.68 &-20.59 &3.32 &5.22 &8.24 
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{(b)}
The sample correlation matrix was 
\begin{equation*}
  \b R =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1.00 &0.86 &0.71 &0.64 &0.65 &0.81 &-0.09 \\ 
    0.86 &1.00 &0.91 &0.89 &0.90 &0.95 &0.10 \\ 
    0.71 &0.91 &1.00 &0.98 &0.98 &0.92 &0.22 \\ 
    0.64 &0.89 &0.98 &1.00 &1.00 &0.90 &0.22 \\ 
    0.65 &0.90 &0.98 &1.00 &1.00 &0.90 &0.24 \\ 
    0.81 &0.95 &0.92 &0.90 &0.90 &1.00 &0.22 \\ 
    -0.09 &0.10 &0.22 &0.22 &0.24 &0.22 &1.00  
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
was is interesting is that the time steps that are close to each other
correlates more than those times further apart. We can even note that
the first and last time steps have negative correlation an is almost 0.

\subsection*{(c)}
\label{sec:c-5}

We can the test if the \textit{average weight} affect the causation of
death by considering the test where each element of the bottom row of $\b
B$ should be equal to zero. We get the hypothesis
\begin{equation*}
  H_0:\ \b{CB} = \b 0,
\end{equation*}
where 
\begin{equation*}
  C = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &0 &0 \\ 
    0 &0 &0 \\ 
    0 &0 &0 \\ 
    0 &0 &0 \\ 
    0 &0 &1   
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
form which could use the test described on page 11 of Lecture 9, and use
the corresponding asymptotic expansion found on page 12 of Lecture 9 to
test on a significance level of 5 \%. We find that 
\begin{align*}
  p &= P(\chi^2 \geq z) + (\gamma/\nu^2)P(\chi^2 \geq z) -  P(\chi^2
      \geq z )\\
    &\approx 0.7931 > 0.05,
\end{align*}
hence we reject $H_0$.
